Bug:
- Language settings did not persist when the app is restarted.
- Rapid changes in rooms/lamps may result in errors or inconsistent data.

TODO:
- Implement Push Notifications.
- Implement Subscribe to Newsletter.
- Smoothen the animation and transitions.

Miscellaneous:
- Lamp Schedule is only a representation in Android-side programming; it should be on the IoT side.
